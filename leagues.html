                <p>The 'Big Five' represent the five most successful football leagues in Europe, which are made up of the Premier League in England, La Liga in Spain, the Bundesliga in Germany, Serie A in Italy and Ligue 1 in France. The combined revenue of these five leagues, which each represent the highest tier football division in their countries, has more than doubled in the past decade, reaching a total of approximately 15.1 billion euros in 2019/20. 

                    The Premier League is the most successful football league out of the five, having reached a revenue of roughly six billion euros in 2020/21. The profitability of the Premier League was close to one billion euros in 2019. In the same year, the wage costs of the leagues ranged from approximately 1.4 billion euros in Ligue 1 in France to 3.5 billion euros in the Premier League. Moreover, the brand values of the respective leagues ranged from 1.3 billion euros in Ligue 1 to 8.6 billion euros in the Premier League.
                    Even though the Premier League is on top in most aspects of football in Europe, it does not have the highest average attendance. Germany's Bundesliga matches have had the highest average attendance since 2005. During the 2018/2019 season, the Bundesliga had an average attendance of 42.74 thousand, followed by the Premier League with 38.48 thousand fans.</p>
